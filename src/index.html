          What follows is a list of the projects I've worked on recently.
          Most are small tools related to Pokemon.  The purpose of this page
          is partly to provide an index page where one does not exist and
          also to serve as an introduction to using Webpack more or less from
          scratch, without the sane defaults provided by vue-cli or similar.
          With any luck, this page will become prettier with time.

          The <a href="https://stalruth.github.io/set-reverser">Pokemon Set Reverser</a> takes a
          Pokemon's Species, Forme, Nature and Stats and calculates how it
          has been trained - valuable for people wanting to recreate teams
          they find on the in-game ladder.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://stalruth.github.io/moveset-planner">Pokemon Moveset Planner</a> accepts a
          <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com">Pokemon Showdown</a> Pokemon
          export and tells you how to obtain the Pokemon with the given moves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://stalruth.github.io/resistance-calculator">Pokemon Tournament Resistance
          Calculator</a> can be used to calculate your opponents'
          collective win ratio, which is used to determine your chances at
          making the single elimination stage of live Pokemon events.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also worked on <a href="https://github.com/JsKingBoo/SableyeBot3">
          SableyeBot</a>, a Discord bot that returns information specifically
          relevant to people who play Pokemon competitively.
